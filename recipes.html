                        <p class="mediumfont">This dish here is very special, for one it takes hours to cook. Albeit it could be a few hours less but anytime I make gumbo, I make a fresh chicken stock. Which is 3-4 hours already, add that to another 2 hours cooking the gumbo…well you get the gist. This dish is worth all the hours it takes to prepare it, perfect at any time of the year and it really is a special meal, serve this to your guests and it will not disappoint. There are many types of gumbo but they are usually classified as either Cajun or Creole, traditionally gumbo is full of all type proteins including pork, shellfish, poultry and sometimes even game. This version is simplified, with chicken, chicken sausage and shrimp being the only proteins in the dish. This my preferred recipe, feel free to add more protein for authenticity but the flavour of gumbo comes from the roux, okra and filé powder although this recipe forgoes the filé.</p>

                                Noodles soups are a personal favourite as they can be so versatile. You can do so much with this kind of dish, from the selection of meats, seafood and plethora of noodle types. This recipe packs so much flavour and is 100% vegan. Although udon is the star in a soup of its own it adds great texture to vegan ramen, where vegetable take centre stage. They also have a wonderful bite. Feel free to opt for meat or seafood in place of shitake mushrooms, although it won’t be the same. This recipe serves one, however double up on ingredients for double servings, you will need a hand-held blender or a blender of some sort.

                    This is a great play on traditional Thai green curry which is usually served with rice and prepared with chicken. Thai green curry, or at least this version pairs well with sweet potato starch noodles as the noodles really absorb sauces and have a great texture. Usually I’d make my own green curry paste but for lack of time and wanting to prepare a quick meal, I opted for store bought. The brand I used is ‘Maesri’, if you prefer to make your own that is always the better option in my opinion. Pair your dish with any vegetables or protein you want, in this case I chose shrimp.
